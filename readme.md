# Portfolio

Welcome to Weston Grewe's portfolio of projects. These projects range from very applied data science (such as analyzing bike lanes in Denver) to pure mathematics. Please check out any of the projects below.

## About Me
Hi, I'm Weston! I am a PhD student in Operations Research at the University of Colorado Denver with an expected graduation data of May 2024. This summer (2022) I will be a data science intern for Transamerica. 

My primary research areas are linear programming and combinatorial optimization. In particular, I am very interested in diameters of polyhedra and circuit augmentation algorithms. Prior to my program at CU Denver, I completed a BS and MS in pure mathematics at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I wrote a senior project where I studied functional analysis and the invariant subspace problem for compact operators. For my master's thesis I homogenized a cardiac tissue model to analyze large scale behavior of the tissue.

Following graduation I hope to break into the data science industry.

## Biking in Denver

In the spring of 2022 I participated in the Data to Policy Symposium hosted by the Auraria Library. My peer [Angela Morrison](http://math.ucdenver.edu/~sborgwardt/wiki/index.php/Angela_Morrison) and I analyzed the feasibility of commuting in Denver. We used a generic shortest path algorithm and a cost-constrained shortest path algorithm to understand the burden that riders face when commuting in the city. We are pleased to report that our project won Best in Data. For a full description of our work please visit our [project page.](http://math.ucdenver.edu/~sborgwardt/wiki/index.php/A_Wheelie_Good_Time:_Safe_Biking_in_Denver) For data cleaning and analysis please see our [GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/DillWithIt77/D2P_Spring_2022) 

## Diameters of Connections of Polyhedra

As part of my PhD thesis, I have been researching diameters of polyhedra. Polyhedral diameters provide a lower bound on the number of pivots the simplex method would take, independent of pivot rule. We proved diameter bounds for polyhedra whose constraint matrix is either a parallel connection or series connection of matrices. The parallel connection and series connection characterize behavior for an optimization problem that has a constraint or variable linking two independent processes. Our work is currently submitted for publication, a preprint is available on [Arxiv.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09587)

## Childhood Obesity in the City of Denver

In the fall of 2021 I submitted two projects to the data to policy symposium. This project is associated with CU Denver's Spatial Data Analysis course. Using data from Denver's Open Data Catalog, I analyzed the distribution of childhood obesity throughout the city to discover if there were any clusters. After performing 6 seperate statistical tests, I discovered there was evidence of clustering. In particular, central north Denver, southwest Denver, and Montbello all exhibited evidence of clustering of childhood obesity cases. My work can be found in [this github repository.](https://github.com/wgrewe/Childhood-Obesity) A slide deck of the results can be found [here.](https://digital.auraria.edu/work/ns/ae3a1cef-3823-44ab-8e54-8a198e58b9a6)
